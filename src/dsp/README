ArtyFX DSP Code
===============
This folder contains the ArtyFX DSP algorithms.
Some of these algorithms are ported from LADSPA
effects, others are generated by FAUST. A final
set are hand coded.

Driva
-----
Driva is based on the Stompbox module of the Rackarack
guitar FX processing application. The DSP code was
significantly tidied up, and bugs fixed. The components
necessary for the Stompbox module are imported - the rest
of the Rackarack source is not included here.

Please refer to the Rackarack project page:
http://rakarrack.sourceforge.net


Kuiza
-----
Based on the 4 band parameteric EQ from the FIL-plugins
by Fons Adriaensen, with custom parameter ranges, preset
frequencies and bandwidths. My thanks go to Fons for
sharing this filter implementation.

The original FIL-plugins are at time of writing available
from the authors download link here:

Panda
-----
Panda is based on the Compander algorithm, which was originally
written by Katja Vetter in PureData. This algorithm was ported
to FAUST by Bart Brouns, aka Magnetophon. The LV2 plugin here
is created using the FAUST generated C++ code.

Thanks to both Katja and Bart! Checkout thier projects here:

Satma
-----
Is a crazy distortion maximizing algorithm based on Barry's Satan
maximizer. Checkout the original by Steve Harris here:
