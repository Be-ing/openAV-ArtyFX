Packaging help
==============
Short guide to building / packaging ArtyFX.

Standard build
--------------
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
make -j2
make install

GUI-less builds
---------------
Please only don't build the UI's if you have a good reason: in general they are
a very important part of the plugins, providing a good workflow.

This switch has been added to ease porting ArtyFX to embedded platforms where
the UI's aren't shown, as they are hardware. 

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DHAVE_NTK=OFF ..
