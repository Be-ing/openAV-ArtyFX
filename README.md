AVTK - OpenAV Productions
==========================

This is the repository for AVTK, an Audio / Visual ToolKit.

General Info
------------
AVTK is based on PUGL and Cairo, two great libraries. It minimizes what 
dependencies it has by using these two frameworks. PUGL is a cross platform GL 
abstraction, while Cairo provides fast vector graphic rendering to GL surfaces.
